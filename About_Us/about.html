        </h1>
        <p id="historyDescription">
          ​Vijayanta Technologies Pvt. Ltd. traces its roots back to the humble
          beginning of the Vijay Electronics, founded by Mr. Ranvijay Singh
          (Managing Director) in June 1965 in Roorkee with limited resources but
          boundless determination. He started the firm as a cottage industry,
          designing products tailored to meet the specific requirements of his
          customers. It was entirely a One-man show in which aspiring to excel
          in the quality of his goods, Ranvijay Singh personally handled the
          product design, production, installations, and demonstrations for his
          esteemed clients. He burnt mid night oil to ensure the high standards
          of quality and performance of all his products. Initially, Vijay
          Electronics focused on manufacturing the very basic and small

          the varied fields of Electronics, Physics, and Electrical Engineering.
          With the passage of time, the company gradually expanded in its
          infrastructure and manufacturing aspects . He realized that to support
          the growing business he now required a reliable and efficient team. He
          went in to constitute it with three members who assisted him. Driven
          by his passion and entrepreneurial spirit, Mr. Ranvijay Singh's
          industriousness and dedication led to herculean growth in sales. The
          demand for Vijay Electronics' quality products soared to the heights
          of success. Prestigious educational institutions such as IIT, and NIT,

          such as railways and electricity departments. It attained overloads of
          appreciation for its performance and service quality and continues to
          do so till. Mr. Vaibhav Singh (Director), Mr.Ranvijay Singh's son,
          took over the responsibility of the business. His focus on product
          promotion and marketing contributed to the company's growth. With the
          passage of time, Vijayanta Technologies Pvt. Ltd. expanded its
          operations with the support of dedicated and capable staff. The team
          toils hard for the best output. Mr. Vaibhav Singh's dedication and
          determination resulted in an annual turnover increase of 40%. A
